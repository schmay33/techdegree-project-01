# techdegree-project-01
 ## Random Quote Generator
 *This is the first project in the Full Stack Tech Degree plan with Team Treehouse.*

 *For this first project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked.* 

 ## My project will be going for the exceeds expectations grading requirement:

 * This means my random quote generator will change the quote on a set interval.
 * Add citation, year, tags, and one of my own properties favorite which will be distiguished by a red heart.
 * The background will change each time the quote is updated with a random color.
